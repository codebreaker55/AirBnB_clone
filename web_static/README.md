a readme file contains the HTML and CSS code that powers the visual presentation and structure of the hbnb project. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to define the content and structure of web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the layout, appearance, and styling of those web pages.

# The HTML files provide the foundation of the project's structure, organizing content into elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. It defines the overall layout and hierarchy of the page, including elements like navigation menus, headers, footers, and content sections.

# CSS files, on the other hand, are responsible for the visual aesthetics and styling of the HTML elements. They control aspects like font styles, colors, spacing, borders, backgrounds, and responsive layouts. By using CSS, we can create visually appealing and consistent designs across different devices and screen sizes.
